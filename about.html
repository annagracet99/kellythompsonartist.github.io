            <p class="blurb">Art has always been a passion for Kelly. Whether it be a “Christmas tree” of oyster shells or a cross adorned with the sea shells. She has always had an eye for creativity and a flair for decorating. <br> <br>
                Until just recently painting was nothing more than walls and trim in her home. In the spring of 2014, she took a canvas and painted her first painting. The subject was a beach scene featuring a little girl, probably inspired from a photo of our beach vacation. <br> <br>
                Since then in her free time “snow days” and track out ‘s from her job with the public schools in North Carolina she has been painting. Her close friend and mentor, Betsy Boyle is an accomplished artist in South Carolina. Betsy has helped Kelly to sharpen her skill by offering tips and critiques of her work shared through text message. Most of her paintings so far have been created as gifts for close friends and family as special pieces for new nursery’s or a Christmas gift portrait of a beloved pet. What she lacks in formal training is made up in passion for her art and a desire to create something special for those she loves. <br> <br>
                Some of her latest work is of pet portraits she offered as a fund-raising project to support youth missions at her church. <br> <br>
                Kelly is a kindergarten instructional assistant with WCPSS who loves the children she works with. <br> <br> -Wes Thompson, her husband.

        <!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
